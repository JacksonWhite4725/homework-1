Homework 1 - DU Coding Bootcamp

This repository is built for the first project at the DU Coding Bootcamp. The mission was to alter a digital marketing website to meet web accessibility standards. To visit the website, click this link: https://jacksonwhite4725.github.io/homework-1/.

To test accessibility standards, I followed the guidelines set forth by the bootcamp. Additionally, I submitted the site to an accessibility checking site (https://www.webaccessibility.com/) and recieved 100% approval.
